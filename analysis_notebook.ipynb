    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Sports League Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sports League problem involves assigning players to teams while satisfying specific constraints and optimizing for team balance. The goal is to create teams with similar average skill levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Definition:**\n",
    "- We have 35 players with different positions (GK, DEF, MID, FWD) and skill levels\n",
    "- We need to assign these players to 5 teams (7 players per team)\n",
    "- Each team must have exactly 1 GK, 2 DEF, 2 MID, and 2 FWD\n",
    "- Each team's total salary must not exceed 750M €\n",
    "- The objective is to minimize the standard deviation of average team skills\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Solution Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent a solution as a list of team assignments for each player. For example, if `solution.repr[0] = 2`, it means player 0 is assigned to team 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search Space Size:**\n",
    "- For 35 players and 5 teams, the theoretical search space is 5^35\n",
    "- With constraints, the actual feasible search space is much smaller, but still extremely large\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Fitness Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The fitness function calculates the standard deviation of the average skill levels across all teams. A lower value indicates more balanced teams, which is our optimization goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "For invalid solutions (those violating constraints), we return infinity to ensure they are never selected."

    "## 3. Algorithm Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Hill Climbing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hill Climbing is a local search algorithm that starts with an initial solution and iteratively moves to better neighboring solutions until no improvement is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "- **Neighborhood Generation**: Defined in `LeagueHillClimbingSolution.get_neighbors()`, which generates valid neighboring solutions by swapping players between teams.\n",
    "- **Selection Strategy**: We use steepest ascent, selecting the best neighbor at each iteration.\n",
    "- **Termination Criteria**: The algorithm stops when no better neighbor is found or after a maximum number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Simulated Annealing\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulated Annealing is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It allows accepting worse solutions with a probability that decreases over time, helping to escape local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "- **Random Neighbor Generation**: Defined in `LeagueSASolution.get_random_neighbor()`, which generates a random valid neighboring solution.\n",
    "- **Acceptance Probability**: Based on the temperature and the fitness difference between the current and new solutions.\n",
    "- **Cooling Schedule**: The temperature decreases over time, reducing the probability of accepting worse solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic Algorithm is a population-based search algorithm inspired by natural selection and genetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "- **Selection Operators**: We've implemented three selection mechanisms:\n",
    "  - Tournament Selection: Selects the best solution from k random candidates.\n",
    "  - Ranking Selection: Selects solutions with probability proportional to their rank.\n",
    "  - Boltzmann Selection: Uses Boltzmann distribution to select solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crossover Operators**: We've implemented three crossover operators:\n",
    "  - One-Point Crossover: Creates a child by taking a portion from each parent.\n",
    "  - One-Point Prefer Valid: Tries multiple cut points to find a valid solution.\n",
    "  - Uniform Crossover: Creates a child by randomly selecting genes from either parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutation Operators**: We've implemented four mutation operators:\n",
    "  - Swap: Randomly swaps two players between teams.\n",
    "  - Swap Constrained: Swaps players of the same position.\n",
